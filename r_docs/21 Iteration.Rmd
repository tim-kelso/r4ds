#1. Compute the mean of every column in mtcars.
output1 <- vector("double", ncol(mtcars))

for (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {
  output1[[i]] <- mean(mtcars[[i]])
}

output1

#2. Determine the type of each column in nycflights13::flights.
output2 <- vector("list", ncol(nycflights13::flights))

for(i in seq_along(nycflights13::flights)) {
  output2[[i]] <- class(nycflights13::flights[[i]])
}

output2


#3. Compute the number of unique values in each column of iris.
output3 <- vector("double", ncol(iris))
names(output3) <- names(iris)
for(i in seq_along(iris)) {
  output3[[i]] <- n_distinct(iris[[i]])
}
output3

#4. Generate 10 random normals from distributions with means of -10, 0, 10, and 100.
n <- 10
mu <- c(-10, 0, 10, 100)
output4 <- vector("list", length(mu))

## 21.3.5 Exercises
``` {r 21.2.1 Exercises}
#1. Imagine you have a directory full of CSV files that you want to read in. You have their paths in a vector, "files <- dir("data/", pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)", and now want to read each one with read_csv(). Write the for loop that will load them into a single data frame.

##output: is a list that is then converted to a data.frame with bind_rows
##sequence: loop through all elements of the vector
##body: read_csv function
files <- c("a.csv", "b.csv", "c.csv")
df_list <- vector("list", length(files))
for (i in seq_along(files)) {
  df_list[[1]] <- read_csv(files[[i]])
}
df_list <- bind_rows(df_list)

#2. A. What happens if you use for (nm in names(x)) and x has no names? 
#B. What if only some of the elements are named? 
#C. What if the names are not unique?
A. Will it give the index for each column? No, it does not run the code in the loop. In other words, it runs zero iterations of the loop.
B. If there only some names, then we get an error for trying to access an element without a name.
C. If the vector contains duplicate names, then x[[nm]] returns the first element with that name.

#3. Write a function that prints the mean of each numeric column in a data frame, along with its name. For example, show_mean(iris) would print:

#show_mean(iris)
#> Sepal.Length: 5.84
#> Sepal.Width:  3.06
#> Petal.Length: 3.76
#> Petal.Width:  1.20

##Output: a list of values and names that is then combined into a data frame
##Sequence: all numeric columns in iris
##Body: mean function
numericCols_iris <- iris %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric))
means_iris <- vector("list", length(numericCols_iris))
for (i in seq_along(numericCols_iris)) {
  #names(means_iris[[i]]) <- names(numericCols_iris[[i]])
  means_iris[[i]] <- mean(numericCols_iris[[i]])
}
means_iris <- unlist(means_iris) #got close? but didn't actually print the variable names together with the numbers

#(Extra challenge: what function did I use to make sure that the numbers lined up nicely, even though the variable names had different lengths?)

#4. What does this code do? How does it work?

#trans <- list( 
# disp = function(x) x * 0.0163871, - mutates display by multiplying it
# am = function(x) { - converts am to a factor
#    factor(x, labels = c("auto", "manual"))
#  }
#)
#for (var in names(trans)) {
#  mtcars[[var]] <- trans[[var]](mtcars[[var]]) - runs the trans function on the variables whenever it appears as a column
#}

```

## 21.4.1 Exercises
``` {r 21.2.1 Exercises}
#1.Read the documentation for apply(). In the 2d case, what two for loops does it generalise?
It applies a for loop columnwise and rowwise. So it does it across columns and by rows

#2.Adapt col_summary() so that it only applies to numeric columns. 
#You might want to start with an is_numeric() function that returns a logical vector that has a TRUE corresponding to each numeric column.


col_summary <- function(df, fun) {
  out <- vector("double", length(df))
  for (i in seq_along(df)) {
    out[i] <- fun(df[[i]])
  }
  out
}

#Function 1
##output: is a logical vector where TRUE corresponds to each numeric column
##sequence: loop through all columns of the dataframe
##body: is_numeric() function

col_summary2 <- function(df, fun) {
  numeric_cols <- vector("logical", length(df)) #create the initial output
  for (i in seq_along(df)) {
    numeric_cols[[i]] <- is.numeric(df[[i]])
  }
  indexes <- which(numeric_cols) #find the numeric cols
  n <- sum(numeric_cols) #find the total number of numeric cols
  out <- vector("double", n) #create an output the length of total number of numeric cols
  for (i in seq_along(indexes)) { #loop along only the numeric col indexes
    out[i] <- fun(df[[indexes[[i]]]]) #apply only at numeric col indexes
  }
  names(out) <- names(df)[indexes]
  out
}
#create a test dataframe first
df <- tibble(
  A = c(1,2),
  B = c("Yes", "No"),
  C = c(80,12),
  D = c(TRUE, FALSE),
  E = c(5,9)
)
col_summary2(df, mean)
```

## 21.5 The map functions
``` {r 21.5 testing}
df2 <- tibble(
  A = c(1,2),
  B = c(4, 6),
  C = c(80,12),
  D = c(2, 5),
  E = c(5,9)
) 

map_dbl(df2, mean) #compute the mean of each column in df, returning a vector of type "double"

df2 %>% map_dbl(mean)

map(df2, summary) %>% #compute summary statistics of each column in df, returning a vector of type "list", which will store multiple values for each column, eg  Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
map_dbl("Median") #then extract the component of the list called "Median"
```
